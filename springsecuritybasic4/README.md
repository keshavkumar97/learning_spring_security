Now in this spring application basically we will try to authenticate multiple user but access will be provided for limited user by configuring a list of user in the configuration file which is also called ***in-memory authentication*** and not by configuring it in property file or using default password.

This type of authentication is used when you know that you have only 5 or 10 users to login i.e. when you have small number of user.

Also, we will be securing some selected endpoints only as we did in earlier example application **springsecuritybasic4**

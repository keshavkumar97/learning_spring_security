Now in this spring application we basically will 
try to authenticate multiple user
(i.e we will have n numbers of user) from our 
database which is also called 
***Jdbc-authentication*** and not by 
configuring users in property file/configuration file 
or using default password.

This type of authentication is used when you 
know that you have **n** number of users to login 
i.e. when you have large number of user for 
your application.

Also, we will be securing some selected 
endpoints only as we did in earlier example 
applications.
